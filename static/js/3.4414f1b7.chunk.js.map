I wanted to make a new personal website as I’ll be starting my PhD studies at the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong starting this September (next week actually!). It will be a more open platform to showcase new things I’ll be working on, and to share ideas and experiences along the way.</p>\n<p>I wanted to build it mostly from scratch and have it hosted for free (this is hosted on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub Pages</a>). So while there are plenty of options/frameworks out there such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, I decided in the end to build an React SPA (Single Page Application) with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html\">create-react-app</a>.</p>\n<p>I had previous experience with React as I had already built a <a href=\"http://sgproductions.github.io/console\">website</a> using it for my old projects (some with some input from friends). However that site, while pretty cool (I think!) was much more of an experiment, had an unconventional layout and the custom art assets were an honest effort <strong>/s</strong>. This time I wanted to build something minimal and clean, and just perhaps also, make it feel a little more unique and homegrown to stand apart from the standard templates/designs out there.</p>\n<p>I didn’t intend to spend too much time on getting this up and running (I did anyway however, as with many software pursuits…see relevant <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1319/\">xkcd comic</a>):</p>\n        <p><XkcdSquare src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png\" alt=\"xkcd Automation\" /></p>\n<p>Therefore I stuck with using create-react-app as the toolchain, having also used it in the previous site deployed to Github Pages. I think it’s fine for a hobby project and I’m still learning as well, and some <a href=\"#GitHubSPA\">hacks</a> are required and caveats do apply. However if you’re looking to do the same, perhaps check out <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby</a> and also other hosts such as <a href=\"https://vercel.com\">Vercel</a> or <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/pricing/\">Netlify</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"responsive-design\">Responsive Design</h2>\n<p>As I wasn’t using any pre-made template, I had to build the layout of the website entirely from scratch and to make sure that it renders properly on mobile devices. I tried my best, hope it looks OK for you no matter what device/browser you use!</p>\n<p>Almost everything on this site is simply styled with CSS (shadows, animations, etc.). I opted to retain the basic layout/look on all devices so the navigation bar is always visible. It does mean that I don’t take advantage of all the screen space on smaller devices, but I think retaining the gaps around the content windows gives the site a distinct look from all the other ones out there. Try viewing it in landscape on your phone too!</p>\n<p>Did I mention that even the scrollbars are styled? Though it only works on Webkit browsers in preserving the rounded corners, but at least Firefox’s ones should still match the theme color.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources-i-used\">Resources I used</h2>\n<p>I don’t have plans to open source the entire website’s codebase at the moment, but I want to share the components/resources I used that makes this possible. This is not an exhaustive nor complete list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles\">tsParticles</a>:</strong> The animated and interactive background for this site, which reacts to mouse hover/clicks. I was building the site in React/JS anyway, so why not make it fancy? I’m currently using the Snow Preset mostly as-is. This might be tweaked/replaced in the future as while it works just fine on my phone, it seems to use quite a bit of CPU/GPU resources on the desktop.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-dark-mode-toggle-with-react-and-themeprovider/\">Implementing Dark Mode</a>:</strong> I originally built the site in a light theme and only thought of adding this after working on another side project. This took an surprising amount of effort, because I had to port all my CSS styles from <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">SASS</a> which I’ve been using to <a href=\"https://styled-components.com\">styled-components</a>. While I already had set up some code reuse with SASS, moving to styled-components further cleaned up my project directory structure.\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/JoseRFelix/react-toggle-dark-mode\">React Toggle Dark Mode</a>:</strong> Animated dark mode toggle in the navigation bar for this site on the top right. The moon icon is a little imperfect at this size, but I think it’s minor and I haven’t figured out how to fix or do my own custom svg animation.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\">Contrast Checker</a>:</strong> The final major colors were tested and checked for suitable contrast using this handy tool on this site, including links.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Paratron/hookrouter\">React Hook Router</a>:</strong> When I was learning React, I followed an old <a href=\"https://www.kirupa.com/react/creating_single_page_app_react_using_react_router.htm\">tutorial</a> which mostly worked around components and standard popular libraries such as <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router\">React Router</a> and <a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/deep-redux-integration\">Redux</a>. But React Hooks was quickly becoming a thing so I migrated to using hooks as I started building my own projects. As I didn’t need Redux for this, I found hookrouter to be a nice simple alternative which works just fine for the basic routing I need, and keeps my code consistent and clean with hooks syntax (Though it does has some issues with React StrictMode I believe).\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"GitHubSPA\" name=\"GitHubSPA\" aria-hidden=\"true\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages\">Single Page Apps for Github Pages</a></strong> GitHub doesn’t actually natively support single page apps, so this workaround is necessary. Hacky but as I have previously used it, it works.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nutboltu/react-search-field/blob/master/src/components/SearchField.jsx\">React Search Field</a>:</strong> Initially I was looking for a component that’s much more usable out-of-the-box to search through my posts list, but I realised that the logic would be restrictive or overly complicated on what I wanted to implement anyway, so I opted to include this search field component and write my own filtering handler. Actually at this point it wouldn’t be much more effort to make my own input box component (then I can also access the styling in a more consistent way), and getting the query text to enable filtering as you type is just another React hook, but this one’s pre-made and exposes the query text so it does the trick.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>I expect that I will be doing a lot more reading and desk research in the coming year as I continue to work on my research proposal and plans. I’m currently trying to migrate to a more suitable workflow/software tools in taking and organising notes for this new work. I’m writing this article in Markdown using <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> (with vim keybindings, of course) right now, and by the time you see it on the site, I should’ve figured a way to convert it to compatible html with <a href=\"https://pandoc.org\">pandoc</a>. Maybe I’ll write more on the tools/workflow I’m using once I settle in.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1445/\">xkcd comic</a> sums it up (they’re are handy aren’t they):</p>\n        <p><XkcdSquare src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/efficiency.png\" alt=\"xkcd Efficiency\" /></p>\n<p>I also hope this site holds up as I add more posts: right now the posts should be set up to be dynamically and lazily loaded in React, but I still have no idea of performance when the total number of posts does grow.</p>\n<p>I might not write often, but hope to see you next post!</p>\n\n      </div>\n    </Window>\n    )\n  )\n};\n\nexport default Aug252021;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
